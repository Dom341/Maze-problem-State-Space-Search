# Maze-problem-State-Space-Search
Utilized Breath First Search, Uniform Cost Search, Greedy Best First Search and A* 
to go through various mazes and return a solution from a start state to a goal state.
This project illustrates the difference in the efficiency of these algorithms. 
The mazes were uploaded in .lay files and read into the program.
